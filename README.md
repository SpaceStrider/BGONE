# BGONE: Missile Guidance Framework for Arma Reforger

BGONE is an advanced missile guidance framework for **Arma Reforger**, originally created by **MBFjeld**. The framework is designed to enhance gameplay by providing a variety of missile guidance systems, allowing for more realistic and tactical engagement scenarios.

## Features

BGONE currently supports multiple guidance methods, including:

- **Visual Locking**: Engage targets based on visual identification and tracking.
- **SACLOS (Semi-Automatic Command to Line of Sight)**: Direct the missile to follow the line of sight using manual control.
- **PLOS (Predicted Line of Sight)**: Predicts the path of a moving target and guides the missile to intercept it.

These features are continuously being improved and expanded, providing players with diverse and immersive missile guidance options.
